# this fonction is used to give the maximum angle before getting a singularity 
# what it does is it takes the parameteres 
# takes a workspace as a mesh grid 
# calculate for every point the jacobienne 
# if the motor is close to a singularity we stop 
# and the motor would be allowed to work only in this
